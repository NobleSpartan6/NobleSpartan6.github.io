            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Loose Screws is a fourth year FTC team from Lakeville, Minnesota. After four years of FTC, Loose Screws has evolved immensely. We were originally known as the Titanium Dragons and were a rookie team. In our second year, we changed our name to Loose Screws and had five teammates. In 2018 we've gained two new members to the team, Nick Mangan and Himal Nenneman. With our diverse team abilities, each of our teammates brings a special skill to the table. Throughout our seasons, we have endured many challenges, but have engineered our way through it all.</p>

                    <p class="lead">﻿FTC is designed for students in grades 7-12 to compete head to head, using a sports model. Teams are responsible for designing, building, and programming their robots to compete in an alliance format against other teams. The robot kit is reusable from year-to-year and is programmed using a variety of languages, this year we are using JAVA. Teams, including coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build robots based on sound engineering principles. Awards are given for the competition as well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments.﻿</p>
